HydroCloud
==========
HydroCloud is a system for viewing and analyzing hydrologic data from multiple sources. It consists of a web app that handles mapping, graphing, and analysis, plus a scalable, distributed database system on the back end that processes NEXRAD imagery and provides precipitation data.

This repository hosts the web client.

A Note to Visitors:
------------------
Please excuse the mess while I migrate the project to GitHub. I am still getting used to the system and figuring out the best way to take advantage of all of GitHub's features.
